// Think of something you could store in a array:
let items = ["pakistan", "karachi", "Hyderabad"];
// Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
let item2 = [];
item2.push("Dubai");
item2.push("Italy");
item2.push("England");
console.log(chalk.black.bgBlueBright("\n\t\t Origonal Array ==>"), items);
console.log(chalk.black.bgBlackBright("\n\t\tContainig item ==>"), item2);
